# VTX Power SWITCH

Contrary to what the documentation suggests, VTX power is actually on USER2.

# Dual Gyros

INAV 7.1 changed the default gyro of the board from the gyro on SPI4 back to the one on SPI1. A new tagrt ```MAMBAH743_2022B_GYRO2``` was added to use gyro on SPI4, in case you suspect an issue with the gyro on SPI1, you can switch to the gyro on SPI4 by using the new target.
